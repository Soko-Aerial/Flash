# Nearby Page (P4 tab)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED
**Component ID:** UI-048
**Last updated:** 2026-08-25
**Owner phase:** Phase 8 / App Shell & Pages Integration (`../ui-page-plan.md` P4)
**Depends on:** UI-001/002/037 tokens, UI-030 banner/badge family, UI-032 `FlashPairingDialog`, UI-025 states, UI-046 shell

---

## Component

`FlashNearbyScreen` (`ui/chat/src/main/java/com/transfer/flash/ui/nearby/FlashNearbyScreen.kt`)
+ demo-shaped `NearbyUiState`. Consumes engine C3 composite-discovery flows + C2 trust store at Phase-8
wiring; until then renders demo state shaped identically.

## Purpose

The radio room: who am I on this network, which humans/devices are within range right now, who do I
already trust, and one tap to pair. Per ui-page-plan P4 — identity card, discovered peer rows with
transport glyph + Connect/Pair, PAIR_REQUEST → `FlashPairingDialog`, trusted-peers section,
background-mode toggle slot, debug-only sim entry.

## Research sources

- Apple AirDrop mental model (behavioral study): identity card up top ("this device"), nearby devices as
  tappable tiles/rows, explicit acceptance on BOTH sides before any transfer — matches Flash's
  user-approval-before-write security rule (§19).
- Android Nearby Share / Quick Share flow: continuous scan affordance (subtle animated indicator, never a
  blocking spinner), device rows appear/disappear gracefully, availability toggle visible.
- [Material 3 guidance — connection states](https://m3.material.io/foundations/designing/structure): scanning
  communicated by motion, results by appearance animation; empty scan explains WHY (radios off) not just
  "nothing found".
- In-repo: `FlashPairingFlow.kt` (UI-032 dialog with countdown/code/pulsing dot — done), 
  `FlashNetworkStatusUi.kt` (UI-030 `FlashTransportBadge` + `transportIconSpec/transportLabel` — done),
  `NsdTransport.kt` identity TXT advertise (deviceId/port fields the identity card displays).

## Existing approaches studied

1. **Grid of big tiles** (AirDrop sheet): charming on iPad, wastes vertical space on phones inside a tab
   that also hosts trusted-peer lists.
2. **Map/radar visualizations** (radar sweep widgets in OSS P2P apps): decorative noise; positions are fake
   (no ranging data); fails §23 measure-don't-decorate.
3. **Sectioned list with identity card header** (Quick Share lineage): chosen — densest honest layout,
   reuses our row language, scales 0→50 peers.

## What worked

- Identity-first layout: answering "what am I findable as?" before "who's out there?".
- Persistent subtle scan motion (pulsing dot) instead of spinner — communicates liveness without anxiety.
- Transport badges per peer (LAN vs Wi-Fi Direct glyph) — Flash-specific honesty about the path your bytes take.
- Empty-with-reason states ("Wi-Fi is off") vs empty-with-next-step ("looking… keep both screens open").

## What did not work

- Radar sweeps / fake distance ordering — dishonest data.
- Auto-connect to discovered peers — violates §19 (user approval before any connection write path).
- Blocking full-screen scan modals — tab must stay live while chatting.

## Chosen approach

```text
FlashNearbyScreen(state, callbacks)
├── Header "Nearby" + scan status line ("Scanning…" w/ pulsing dot | "N devices")
├── Identity card: Device-icon medallion · display name · "id ab12cd34 · port 4747"
│   (background-mode toggle row pinned here per page-plan)
├── Section DISCOVERED: peer rows — medallion(Device icon) · name · FlashTransportBadge
│   · trailing Connect button (haptic Tick)
├── Section TRUSTED PEERS: Verified-tinted rows · Revoke text-button (Confirm haptic)
└── Overlays: FlashPairingDialog when state.pairingRequest != null
States: isLoading→skeleton rows ; !radiosAvailable→explainer panel (why+how) ;
        scanning&empty→"Looking for nearby devices…" pulsing panel ; peers>0→sections
```

Models:

```kotlin
data class NearbyIdentityUi(name, deviceIdShort, port)
data class NearbyPeerUi(id, name, transport: FlashNetworkTransport, signalSortKey: Int = 0)
data class NearbyTrustedPeerUi(id, name, verifiedSinceMs)
data class NearbyUiState(
    identity, isScanning, radiosAvailable,
    peers: List<NearbyPeerUi>, trustedPeers: List<NearbyTrustedPeerUi>,
    pairingRequest: FlashPairingRequestUi? = null,
    isLoading = false,
)
```

## Why it was chosen

Every element maps to an existing shipped component (badge/dialog/icons/states) — this page is assembly
plus one new row type, honoring §3 (no new deps) and §34 (no whole-screen work before components exist).
Demo-state shape mirrors future C3/C2 outputs so wiring is substitution.

## Visual specification

| Element | Token |
|---|---|
| Cards | `backgroundSurface` radius12 |
| Identity medallion | accentPrimary @10% bg circle, Device icon accentPrimary (matches UI-025 medallion) |
| Peer medallion | `backgroundSurfaceStrong` circle, Device icon textSecondary |
| Scan pulse | accentPrimary dot, gentle spring scale loop, reduce-motion → static |
| Connect button | pill, accentPrimary bg, textOnAccent label, radiusFull |
| Revoke | captionEmphasis textError |

## Interaction specification

- Tap peer Connect: emits `onConnectClick(peer)`; engine decides connect-vs-pair; dialog mounts on event.
- Long-press peer: none v1.
- Revoke: single tap fires callback (trust store confirms internally later; no double dialog v1).
- Background toggle: Switch row, Tick haptic on change.

## Animation specification

| Effect | Spec |
|---|---|
| Branch swap (radios-off ⇄ loading ⇄ empty ⇄ populated) | `AnimatedContent` targeting a private `NearbyPageState` **enum** from a pure `pageState()` helper — targeting the whole `NearbyUiState` would restart the crossfade on every discovery tick |
| Scan indicator | `rememberInfiniteTransition` 1.0↔1.3 scale, `emphasisMillis` Standard, `RepeatMode.Reverse`; the value is read inside `graphicsLayer` so the header does not recompose per frame; not started at all under reduce-motion (static dot) |
| Peer / trusted row appear-disappear | `Modifier.animateItem(motion.messagePlacementSpec(), motion.messageFadeOutSpec())` keyed by device id — the list item animates itself, because an `AnimatedVisibility(visible = true)` on a freshly composed row can never play |
| Connect / Revoke press | `Modifier.flashPressScale(interactionSource)` with `indication = null`; Connect fires `FlashHaptic.Tick`, Revoke `FlashHaptic.Confirm` (it is destructive) |
| Dialog | FlashPairingDialog internal choreography (UI-032, already built) |
| Reduce-motion | tokens self-collapse; the pulse loop is skipped rather than run at zero duration |

## Gesture specification

None beyond taps; list does not swipe (revoke is explicit button). RTL mirrors.

## Accessibility requirements

- Rows merge semantics: "<name>, <transport label>, Connect button".
- Scan state announced via status line text (not color/motion only).
- 48dp targets; section headers as headings; dialog inherits UI-032 a11y (done there).

## Responsive behavior

Phone-first single column; expanded-width policy deferred to UI-034 pass (page-plan step 6).

## Dark-mode behavior

Token-driven; badges/medallions use audited surface/accent pairs from UI-035.

## Performance considerations

Keyed rows by deviceId; discovery churn animates only entering/exiting rows; pulse loop runs in
graphicsLayer (no recomposition per frame).

## Implementation notes

- Files: `ui/nearby/FlashNearbyScreen.kt` (+models/math/demo sampler);
  tests `ui/nearby/FlashNearbyLogicTest.kt`.
- Dependencies added: **none**. Engine wiring (C3/C2) substitutes demo state at checklist step 4.
- Post-UI-046 fix pass (2026-08-25): content sits inside a `statusBarsPadding()` wrapper while the
  pairing dialog stays its **sibling** (its scrim is an in-tree `Box`, not a platform `Dialog`, so
  insetting it would leave the status-bar strip unscrimmed); discovered/trusted rows use
  `Modifier.animateItem(...)` instead of an `AnimatedVisibility(visible = true)` that could never play;
  `PeerRow` gained the missing 12dp end gutter (the Connect pill was flush to the card edge); the scan
  dot's pulse is read inside `graphicsLayer` and sized from a named `8.dp` constant instead of
  `borderHairline * 6`.
- Shell-motion pass (2026-08-25): `listState: LazyListState` and `bottomInset: Dp` are now parameters
  supplied by `MainActivity`. Hoisting the scroll state is mandatory — `FlashAnimatedScreen` disposes
  the outgoing page on a tab hop, so a page-local state would reset scroll every switch and break
  re-select-to-top. `bottomInset` is added to the `LazyColumn` `contentPadding` bottom so rows scroll
  under the hanging capsule.

## Addendum — "Scan network" action (DR3, DESIGNED and IMPLEMENTED 2026-09-29; device check DR-03 pending)

Why: some networks hide devices from discovery (multicast filtered, hotspot clients, client isolation off but
mDNS dropped). DR3 (`../network/DISCOVERY-RESILIENCE-PLAN.md` §3.3 C, ADR-047) probes the local subnet for the
Flash port and hands hits to the connection planner. This is the manual trigger and its result line. The
automatic fallback needs no UI.

Approaches compared:

1. **Icon button in the header beside "Connect by IP"** — one tap, no words. Rejected: no fitting Flash icon
   exists (a radar or search glyph would need the UI-002 icon process), stock Material icons are prohibited
   (§34), and two unlabeled icons side by side hide which one does what.
2. **Text action in the header + a second pill in the empty panel, with a caption line for the result** —
   chosen. Words say what it does, the empty panel is where a user who found nothing is looking, and no icon
   work is needed. The caption is the only place the outcome can be told honestly (a scan can find nothing).
3. **Pull-to-refresh on the list** — familiar on a phone, but it competes with scrolling, does not exist with a
   mouse on the desktop, and a sweep is not a refresh of a list (it can take seconds and may refuse).
   Rejected.
4. **Automatic only, no control** — rejected: the owner wants a manual action, and the automatic fallback waits
   60 s of silence and runs once per 10 minutes at most, which is too slow to be the answer to "why can't I see
   my laptop".

Specification:

- Model `NearbyNetworkScan` in `NearbyUiState.scan`: `Idle`, `Running(percent)`, `Done(answered, narrowed)`,
  `Unavailable(reason)` with `NearbyScanBlock { NO_NETWORK, NOT_LOCAL, TOO_SMALL, TOO_SOON }`. The UI never sees
  hosts, ports or subnets (§22: no protocol details in the normal UI).
- Callback `onScanNetwork: (() -> Unit)?`. Null hides the action, like the other optional actions on this screen.
- Header: a text action "Scan network" (`captionEmphasis`, `accentPrimary`, 48 dp target) left of the
  Connect-by-IP icon. While `Running` it reads "Scanning…" in `textTertiary` and does nothing.
- Empty panel: a secondary pill "Scan network" under "Connect by IP" (`backgroundSurfaceStrong` fill, accent label),
  so the primary action stays the manual IP.
- Caption line under the status line (header) and under the buttons (empty panel), `metadataDefault` in
  `textSecondary`, from `FlashNearbyMath.scanCaption`:
  Running "Scanning this network… 42%"; Done with hits "Found 2 devices to connect to."; Done with none
  "Scan finished. No devices answered."; a narrowed scan adds "Only this device's part of a large network was
  checked."; Unavailable: "Not connected to a local network." / "This isn't a home or office network, so Flash
  won't scan it." / "There is nobody else on this link." / "Scanned a moment ago. Try again shortly."
- The caption of a finished or refused scan disappears after 6 s (UI-local timer keyed by the state). A running
  scan's caption stays until it ends.
- Motion: none of its own. The caption was specified to crossfade with `statusCrossfade`; **implemented without it**
  (the line appears and disappears), which needs no reduce-motion branch. Revisit at polish if it reads as abrupt.
- Accessibility: the action has a text label, so no `contentDescription` is needed; the caption is plain text
  that a screen reader reads when it changes.

Testing (JVM): `scanCaption` copy for every state; percent rounding. Device: **DR-03** in
`../testing/TEST-BACKLOG.md`.

## Testing checklist

- [x] JVM: sorting/dedup/count labels/state derivation
- [x] JVM: "Scan network" caption copy for every state, and the desktop `SweepState` → scan mapping (DR3)
- [ ] Physical device: "Scan network" header action, empty-panel pill and caption (DR-03)
- [ ] Compose preview light/dark × empty/scanning/populated/dialog
- [ ] Physical device: live NSD feed post-wiring; pairing round-trip
- [ ] Physical device: discovery churn — rows glide in/out, no full-page crossfade per tick
- [ ] Physical device: scroll position survives a tab hop; re-selecting Nearby scrolls to top
- [ ] Reduced motion: static scan dot, rows snap

## Known limitations

- Demo data until C3/C2 wiring; port/device-id strings placeholder-formatted.
- No permission pre-flight explainer yet (page-plan open item) — radios-off panel covers the common case.
- Scroll position survives rotation but not process death (host `remember`, see UI-046 limitations).

## Future improvements

- Permission pre-flight cards (Nearby Wi-Fi devices / location / notifications).
- Signal-strength ordering once RSSI exposed; distance stays out (no ranging data).

## What makes this Flash?

Other transfer apps make discovery a carnival — radar sweeps, confetti, giant buttons. Flash treats it
like presence in a messenger: quiet identity card, calm rows that fade in like messages, a transport
glyph that tells the truth about the path ahead, and the same teal pulse from the nav bar breathing
under "Scanning…" — the P2P heartbeat made visible.
