# Library-compliance review

> **Status note 2026-10-09 (docs verification): HISTORICAL.** This review is a snapshot of 2026-09-12 (commit `e012bed`). Its findings predate the Kotlin Multiplatform conversion, `:core:swarm`, the desktop hosts and the 2.1.0-beta release preparation, so check any finding against the current code before acting on it. Kept as the record of how the project got here (AGENTS.md section 27). For the current structure read `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/public-api.md` and `docs/developer-guide/`; where this page disagrees with the code, the code wins.

**Date:** 2026-09-12
**Tree:** `dev` at `e012bed` + the uncommitted working tree
**Scope:** the published `core-*` / `ui-*` artifacts and the app as a consumer of them
**Method:** read-only inspection of the build files, publication config, published metadata (local
throwaway repos), public API surface, docs, CI config and test harnesses. No behaviour was changed by
the review itself.

## Verdict

The library is **well above average for a pre-release project** and matches industry practice on the
things that are hardest to retrofit later: a strict, explicitly-declared public API, a written API
specification, consumer-shaped test modules that reproduce a downstream classpath, sources jars,
published ProGuard rules and a documented dependency-closure discipline.

The gaps are almost all **release-process**, not API design: the CI gate does not run on the branch
that is actually used, nothing verifies the *published* artifacts, and there is no ABI-stability check
between releases. Both release blockers hit on 2026-09-11 (`ui-platform-shims` missing from the
publication set, and `api(project(":core:ptt"))` on the wrong target) were invisible to the current
CI, which is the strongest argument for fixing the process gaps first.

## What already meets industry practice

| Practice | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Published artifact set with stable coordinates | `jitpack.yml`; per-module `artifactId` renames in place (`docs/publishing/PHASE-06-jitpack-publishing.md`) |
| Single source of truth for the version | `build.gradle.kts` `flashLibraryVersion`, with a rule that modules must not set `version`/`groupId` |
| Strict explicit API on the library tier | `explicitApi()` in every `core/*` module (ADR-023) |
| Internal-but-cross-module API kept opt-in | `@FlashInternalApi` (opt-in level ERROR) from `:core:common` |
| Written public API specification | `docs/architecture/public-api.md` (1.3.0) |
| Consumer-classpath test modules | `:sample:consumer` (umbrella-only) and `:sample:consumer-granular` (single artifact) |
| Facade contract test on a genuinely calling-free classpath | `sample/consumer/src/test/.../UmbrellaFacadeContractTest.kt` |
| Sources jars on published artifacts | KMP default for KMP modules; explicit `withSourcesJar()` for the AGP-only ones |
| Consumer ProGuard rules | `consumer-rules.pro` in every published module except `ui/platform-shims` |
| Licence hygiene | `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0), `NOTICE` |
| Dependency-scope discipline, documented | `api` vs `implementation` with rationale in each module and `docs/publishing/PHASE-02-dependency-scope.md` |
| Stability signalling | "Supported" / "Experimental" labels in README, `@FlashInternalApi`, ADR trail (023/025/032/033) |
| Normalized line endings / binary handling | `.gitattributes` |

## Findings

Severity reflects risk to a downstream consumer or to release safety.

### F1 - CI never runs on the working branch (High, process)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggers on `push: branches: [ main ]` and on pull requests. All work in
this repository happens on `dev`, so the gate runs only when something reaches `main`. A PR-based flow
would cover it, but direct pushes to `dev` are the actual practice.

**Fix:** add `dev` to the push branches (or use a branch-list filter that includes every long-lived
integration branch).

### F2 - Nothing verifies the published artifacts (High)

CI runs `testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug`. Nothing publishes the module set to a local repository and
then resolves it as a consumer would.

Every release blocker found on 2026-09-11 was of exactly this shape and none of them could be seen by
the current CI:

- `ui-platform-shims` was a runtime dependency written into `ui-chat`'s POM but absent from the
  `jitpack.yml` install line and the README table, so every `ui-chat` consumer would have failed to
  resolve;
- `core-ptt` was a new published module missing from the same list;
- `api(project(":core:ptt"))` sat on `:core:engine`'s commonMain, which resolved for the Android
  target but broke variant selection for the JVM target and for `publishToMavenLocal`.

The `:sample:*` modules cannot catch this class of bug: they depend on `project(...)`, not on published
coordinates, so they never exercise the POM or Gradle Module Metadata.

**Fix:** a CI job that runs the `jitpack.yml` install line into a throwaway `maven.repo.local`, then
compiles a minimal consumer project against `com.transfer.flash:core-engine:<version>` resolved from
that repository, and fails if any declared dependency is missing from it.

### F3 - No ABI-stability gate between releases (High)

`kotlinx-binary-compatibility-validator` was removed with a documented rationale: under AGP 9's
built-in Kotlin plugin it registered no tasks for Android library variants, so it was inert
(see the comment in the root `build.gradle.kts`, ADR-023). `explicitApi()` guarantees that every
symbol is a deliberate decision, but it does **not** detect a signature change that breaks binary
compatibility between `1.1.0` and the next tag, and nothing else does either.

**Fix (needs a decision):** either re-introduce BCV where it does work (the KMP modules publish a JVM
target, so `apiDump`/`apiCheck` on that target is meaningful), or replace it with an explicit
"published ABI snapshot + diff in CI" check. Do not simply leave it absent and assume
`explicitApi` covers it: those two tools answer different questions.

### F4 - Version and documentation drift (Medium)

`public-api.md` is stamped `1.3.0`, the README install snippets target `v1.1.0`, and
`flashLibraryVersion` is `1.1.0`. The doc version has been bumped by documentation passes without a
corresponding release. A consumer reading the docs cannot tell which API version they are looking at.

**Fix:** decide the next tag, set `flashLibraryVersion` in the same commit that bumps the API doc, and
make the README snippets reference the released tag only.

### F5 - No CHANGELOG (Medium)

Release history lives in git tags, `logs/progress.md` and the ADR trail. For a published library, a
`CHANGELOG.md` is the conventional place a consumer looks for "what changed and does it affect me".

**Fix:** start one at the next release; backfill the `1.1.0` section from `logs/` if the history
matters.

### F6 - No static analysis and no editor config (Medium)

There is no detekt, no ktlint and no `.editorconfig`. Formatting and small-defect consistency
therefore depends on reviewer attention. This repository has unusually thorough prose-level
conventions (AGENTS.md, KDoc style, log formats) that tooling cannot enforce.

**Fix:** add ktlint (or detekt) with a minimal ruleset and an `.editorconfig`, then wire it into the
same CI job. Expect a large first pass of formatting churn; scope it to the published modules first.

### F7 - KDoc coverage on the public API is thin (Medium)

`explicitApi()` forces every declaration to declare its visibility, but documentation is optional and
often absent: a mechanical count of declarations against a preceding KDoc block gives roughly
**32%** for `core/messaging` commonMain and **49%** for `core/calling` (the measure is approximate -
it counts declarations mechanically, not semantic API surface). `public-api.md` compensates for
consumers who read the specification, but IDE hover and generated documentation do not.

**Fix:** require KDoc for declarations that appear in `public-api.md`, enforced by review rather than
tooling; consider Dokka if generated HTML docs are wanted for the release.

### F8 - The app is not a consumer of its own facade (Medium, architectural)

`grep -rn "FlashEngine" app/src` returns nothing: the app wires `DiscoveryEngineHolder`/`AppEngine` by
hand and never calls `Flash.create`. The published entry point is exercised only by
`:sample:consumer`'s contract test. This is a deliberate, documented position (ADR-033 point 6), but
it means the app cannot feel a public-API regression, and the facade has exactly one consumer - a test.

**Fix (needs a decision):** either migrate the app onto the facade incrementally (one subsystem at a
time, starting where the wrapper is thinnest), or accept the sample as the contract consumer and keep
the facade's test coverage deliberately thick. Do not leave it implicit: today the only thing keeping
the facade honest is the sample test.

### F9 - No dependency verification (Low)

`gradle/verification-metadata.xml` is absent, so nothing pins or verifies the checksums of the
third-party graph. Standard supply-chain hardening for a library, low urgency for a JitPack-distributed
pre-release.

**Fix:** `./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256 help` plus the needed task set; commit the
file and expect to update it when dependencies change.

### F10 - Small hygiene items (Low)

- `ui/platform-shims` ships no `consumer-rules.pro` although every other published module does
  (the module needs none today, but the asymmetry is unexplained).
- No `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` or `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. Acceptable for a solo project; worth
  adding if external contributors are expected.

## What CI would and would not catch today

| Class of defect | Caught by current CI? |
| --- | --- |
| Compile errors across modules | Yes (`assembleDebug`) |
| Unit tests (including the KMP host tests and the consumer sample) | Yes (`testDebugUnitTest`) |
| `implementation`-vs-`api` leaks on a consumer's *compile* classpath | Yes - the `:sample:*` modules exist for this |
| Missing module on the publication list | **No** |
| Wrong target for a dependency (`commonMain` vs `androidMain`) | **No** - it breaks only the JVM target and publishing |
| POM / Gradle Module Metadata errors | **No** |
| ABI break between releases | **No** |
| Dependency-scope decision that is correct but undocumented | **No** |

## Recommended order

1. **F2 - publish-then-consume CI job.** Highest value: it covers the defect class that has already
   produced two release blockers, and it makes the `jitpack.yml` install line self-checking.
2. **F1 - run CI on `dev`.** One-line change; without it F2 never executes.
3. **F4 + F5 - release discipline.** Decide the next tag, align `flashLibraryVersion`, the API doc and
   the README, and start a CHANGELOG.
4. **F3 - ABI gate.** Needs a decision (BCV on the JVM target vs a published-ABI snapshot diff).
5. **F6 + F7 - static analysis and KDoc on the documented API surface.**
6. **F8 - facade adoption.** Needs a decision; the status quo is defensible only while the sample test
   stays thick.
7. **F9 + F10 - hygiene.**

## Limits of this review

- No device was involved, so nothing here speaks to runtime behaviour.
- The KDoc figure is a mechanical count, not a semantic measurement of the documented API surface.
- Dependency-scope choices were inspected for *consistency with their stated rationale*, not
  re-derived from first principles for each module.
- JitPack itself was not run; publication evidence comes from local repositories
  (`-Dmaven.repo.local=...`) and from inspecting the generated POM / Gradle Module Metadata.
- The app/UI tiers were reviewed as consumers of the library, not as product code.

## Addendum - 2026-09-12 (findings below were produced by trying to *use* CI)

The three open PRs (#3 Palette, #4 Bolt, #5 Sentinel) were synced with `dev` and landed. Because
GitHub Actions could not run (see A2), verification was done locally instead - and doing that exposed
two more findings, one of which is a bigger gap than anything in the main list.

### A1 - CI's test command silently skips every KMP module (High - supersedes the F1/F2 priority)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug`. `testDebugUnitTest` does
**not exist** for the KMP modules:

```text
Cannot locate tasks that match ':core:messaging:testDebugUnitTest' as task
'testDebugUnitTest' not found in project ':core:messaging'.
```

Gradle does not fail the invocation when a task name matches nothing in a project, so the workflow
reports success while covering only the plain AGP modules (`:app`, `:core:calling`, `:core:ptt`,
`:ui:callui`, `:sample:*`). Every KMP module's suite is skipped: `core:common`, `core:discovery`,
`core:network`, `core:transfer`, `core:messaging`, `core:persistence`, `core:security`, `core:engine`,
`ui:theme`, `ui:chat`, `ui:platform-shims`.

The aggregate that does exist is `allTests` (present in every KMP module, confirmed by a dry run).

**Fix:** `./gradlew allTests testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug`. That one word is the difference between
running the library's tests and not running them.

### A2 - GitHub Actions is locked for billing, so no workflow runs at all (blocker)

Every run for all three PRs failed in 2-6 seconds with:

```text
The job was not started because your account is locked due to a billing issue.
```

This is an account-level blocker, not a workflow bug, and it must be cleared before F1/F2 are worth
doing: adding `dev` to the trigger list and adding a publish-then-consume job achieve nothing while
jobs cannot start. Until then, **all verification in this repository is local-only**.

### A3 - Two pre-existing failures that CI has therefore never seen (High)

Running the correct aggregate locally on the merged `dev` (`2fc4f17`) surfaced:

```text
:core:common:allTests FAILED
FlashPerformanceClassifierTest > ptime_choice_is_what_moves_header_overhead FAILED
FlashPerformanceClassifierTest > tiers_are_monotone_in_cost FAILED
```

`:core:common` is untouched by any of the three PRs (its last change is `be57111`,
"perf(calling): optimize voice packetization, enable DTX ..." - the same commit that last touched the
classifier). The same two failures reproduce at `3580666`, the commit `dev` was on before the merges,
so they are pre-existing and were not introduced here. They are almost certainly a consequence of that
perf commit changing `FlashPerformanceClassifier` without its tests being re-run - which is exactly
what A1 makes possible.

**Fix:** update the classifier's expectations (or the classifier) and re-run `:core:common:allTests`;
then A1 so it cannot happen silently again.

**Resolved 2026-09-12** (same day, next session): the expectations were the stale side. `be57111`
retuned `FlashVoiceProfile.HIGH` (ptime 10→20 ms, DTX off→on) deliberately — it updated
`:core:calling`'s `CallSdpTest` for exactly this change but missed these two `:core:common` pins
(the file's only other commits are the original `268487f`; `git log be57111..HEAD -- core/common`
is empty). The production values are the intended ones, so the two tests were updated to pin them:

- `ptime_choice_is_what_moves_header_overhead`: HIGH 50 pps / ≥20 kbit/s header (was 100 / ≥40).
  The header-overhead *mechanism* the test exists for is unchanged — ptime is still the knob.
- `tiers_are_monotone_in_cost`: voice monotonicity relaxed from strict to `>=`/`<=` (MEDIUM and
  HIGH now share 20 ms by design), with a new endpoint assertion that LOW stays strictly cheaper
  than HIGH so the relaxation cannot mask a full collapse to one ptime.

`:core:common:testAndroidHostTest` — 23 tests / 0 failures after the change. A1's workflow fix
(`allTests testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug`, `dev` trigger) is applied in the same pass; A2 (billing
lock) remains the only open item in this addendum.

### A4 - PR bookkeeping note

Because the branches were merged locally (A2 made the GitHub-side path unavailable), GitHub marked
#3 and #5 as merged on detection of the pushed commits, but #4 had to be closed manually: its head
commit is already an ancestor of `dev`, so GitHub could not create a merge commit for it. Closing it
loses no work - it is in `dev` via merge commit `f057331`.
