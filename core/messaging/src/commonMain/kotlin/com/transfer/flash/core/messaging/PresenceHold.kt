 * Offline through a sub-second session swap. The sets are disjoint.

/**
 * Splits a live-session set into [PresenceSnapshot.online] / [PresenceSnapshot.connecting] with a
 * per-departure grace period of [holdMs].
 *
 * Rising edge is instant. On a falling edge the peer moves to `connecting` and a **hard deadline**
 * is stamped for it: `holdMs` after *that departure*, it becomes fully absent (in neither set)
 * whether or not anything else happened in between.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `transformLatest { … delay(holdMs) }` (ERROR-031)
 *
 * The previous implementation held the falling edge inside `transformLatest`, which cancels its
 * block on every upstream emission. A peer reconnecting every 1–4 s therefore cancelled the pending
 * Offline verdict before it could ever fire, and — because the same body emitted `shown + live`
 * first — the dot stayed **Online with an empty session set**, indefinitely. That is the "peer shows
 * Online while its app is not even running" report: the header promised a link the transport could
 * not deliver, so a send single-ticked into a socket that no longer existed.
 *
 * Here the timer is a *sibling* of the collector rather than its child, so no upstream traffic can
 * cancel it, and the deadline is stamped with `putIfAbsent` — a peer that keeps reappearing cannot
 * refresh its own deadline. A peer that is genuinely gone therefore reaches "absent" exactly
 * [holdMs] after its last departure, and while it is held it is reported *Connecting*, never Online.
