/**
 * Seam between the C4 TLS layer and the persistent TOFU trust store (C2.5 / `RoomTrustedStore`).
 *
 * The network module deliberately knows nothing about Room or `:core:security` (Ground Rule R2):
 * the engine wiring layer injects an implementation backed by the paired-peer table once C4/C7
 * integration lands. Until then, tests supply in-memory maps.
 *
 * Contract for implementers:
 * - [fingerprintHex] arrives **normalized** (uppercase, no colons/spaces — see [normalize]).
 *   Store lookups should normalize stored values identically ([normalize]) before comparing.
 * - Equality checks MUST be constant-time (`MessageDigest.isEqual`) so pin comparisons never
 *   leak prefix-match timing — same convention as `FlashFingerprint.constantTimeEquals`.
