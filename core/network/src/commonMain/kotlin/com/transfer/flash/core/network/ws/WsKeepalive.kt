/**
 * Liveness bookkeeping for one [WsConnection]'s keepalive loop, extracted so the decision is a
 * pure function of (clock, inbound traffic, tick arrivals) and therefore JVM-testable without
 * sockets or coroutine test infrastructure.
 *
 * ## The problem this encodes (ERROR-025)
 *
 * The naive check — "close if `now - lastInbound > livenessTimeout`" — is correct only while the
 * loop it runs in is actually being scheduled. On Android it is not: with the screen off, the app
 * backgrounded, or the process Doze-frozen, a `delay(10_000)` can return a minute later. The first
 * resumed tick then measures how long the *process* slept, blames the *peer*, and closes a session
 * that is perfectly alive. Both peers do it at the same moment, so a phone that was merely
 * backgrounded appears to go offline and come back, and everything sent in that window — chat
 * messages, `FLASH_CALL` signaling — fails for want of a session.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A tick also reports how long it has been since the *previous* tick, measured with the same
 * clock. When that gap is far larger than the interval the loop asked for, the scheduler did not
 * run, so nothing about the peer can be inferred: the silence window is forgiven (rebased to now),
 * a PING is sent, and the verdict is deferred to a tick that ran on time.
 *
 * ## Why forgiveness is bounded (ERROR-031)
 *
 * Forgiveness used to be unbounded: *every* stalled tick rebased the window. On a device that
 * throttles background coroutines hard enough that ticks are chronically late, the watchdog then
 * never renders a verdict at all, and a session whose socket is long dead stays in
 * `activeSessions` forever — a zombie. That is worse than a false close, because presence is
 * computed from that map and every reconnect path in the app skips peers that already have a
 * session, so nothing else reaps it either.
 *
 * So a stall episode is forgiven **once**. The first stalled tick rebases and arms a probe; while
 * that probe is outstanding — no inbound frame of any kind since it was armed — a further stalled
 * tick may re-PING but may **not** rebase, which lets the ordinary silence window keep growing
 * until it renders a verdict.
 *
 * A verdict rendered by a stalled tick carries [Verdict.Close.needsConfirmation], because that
 * tick had itself just resumed and the read loop resumes on its own dispatcher: a PONG already
 * sitting in the socket buffer may not have been stamped yet. [confirmClose] re-reads the
 * timestamp after a short *awake* delay and withdraws the verdict if the peer proved itself.
 *
 * ## Fewer pings (PC1, `docs/network/PRESENCE-CONNECTIONS-PLAN.md` §3.3)
 *
 * The verdict decides *whether* a ping is worth sending, not only whether the peer is dead:
 * - **One pinger per pair.** Once both HELLOs are in, [role] says which side keeps the pair alive
 *   ([resolveRole]). The [PingRole.ANSWERER] only answers, and pings on its own only when the
 *   pinger has been quiet for longer than a pinger ever should be ([answererProbeAfterMs]), so a
 *   disagreement about roles degrades to both sides pinging — never to neither.
 * - **Traffic counts as proof.** No ping when frames went *both* ways within half an interval. One
 *   direction is not enough: the peer's watchdog is fed by what *we* send, so a phone that only
 *   receives must keep pinging.
 * Stall probes (ERROR-025) and the close rules are unchanged by either.
 *
 * Not thread-safe by itself; [WsConnection] confines [onTick]/[confirmClose] to one tick at a time
 * and marks the cross-thread fields volatile.
