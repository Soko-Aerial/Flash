 * Per-peer bounded send queue (plan C4.5 / upgrade 5).

 * Capacity 64 (documented choice): Little's-Law sizing for chat traffic -
 * at a typical interactive drain rate this absorbs multi-hundred-message
 * bursts (attachment fan-out to one peer) while bounding worst-case queue
 * latency and per-peer memory. It is deliberately NOT sized for sustained
 * overload: sustained producer>consumer means the session is dying anyway
 * and the outbox must retain writes.
 *
 * Backpressure mode: **reject-newest (fail fast)** - chosen over
 * drop-oldest and block:
 * - Not drop-oldest: Flash frames are user messages / transfer chunks where
 *   every item matters (research: "drop when newer data invalidates older" -
 *   live video/sensors - does not apply). Silent eviction would corrupt FIFO
 *   ordering guarantees C6 relies on for revision/receipt replay.
 * - Not block: a blocked producer holds the caller's coroutine on a dead
 *   peer's queue - deadlock-prone under exactly the failure conditions
 *   (half-open socket) this class exists to survive. Research: fail-fast is
 *   correct when "the caller has a fallback" - here the fallback is the
 *   durable outbox owned by C6.
 *
 * Thread-safe: multiple producers, single logical consumer (drain loop).
