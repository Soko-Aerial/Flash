/**
 * Signaling-keepalive, reconnect and call-recovery timings for one [FlashPerformanceMode].
 *
 * ## What the field report actually said
 *
 * "The Pixel and Infinix recover fine but it doesn't for the BelFone." The mesh in question is
 * several APs presenting one SSID, so a walking user roams between them. The interesting part is
 * the word *recover*: every device loses the link during a roam. What separates them is what
 * happens next.
 *
 * On a 2.4 GHz-only b/g/n client with no 802.11k/v/r fast-transition support, a roam is a full
 * scan, reassociation and DHCP — seconds, not milliseconds. And because the roam keeps the same
 * Android `Network` object, `ConnectivityManager.onAvailable` never fires, so nothing in the app
 * used to learn that the link had moved (see `AndroidNetworkWatcher`). The session was left to
 * die of its own watchdog and then to be redialled by a backoff loop whose ceiling is 30
 * seconds. Two seconds of radio outage therefore turned into up to half a minute of "offline".
 *
 * So the tier knobs here are not mainly about *patience* — the existing 25 s liveness window
 * already survives an ordinary roam. They are about **how fast the stack gets back**, which is
 * [reconnectCapMs], plus giving a call's ICE restart enough room to complete
 * ([callDisconnectGraceMs]).
 *
 * ## Confidence
 *
 * [reconnectCapMs] and [callDisconnectGraceMs] are derived from the mechanism and are the ones
 * this tiering is confident about. [pingIntervalMs] is a battery/airtime judgement rather than a
 * measured one and is the first number to revisit against field data — a longer interval saves
 * radio wake-ups but gives the watchdog fewer inbound frames to see.
 *
 * @param pingIntervalMs application-level keepalive period on a WS session.
 * @param livenessTimeoutMs silence after which a session is declared dead. Must stay comfortably
 *   above `pingIntervalMs * WsKeepalive.STALL_FACTOR`, or a merely-late tick becomes a verdict.
 * @param reconnectCapMs ceiling on the reconnect backoff. The single most load-bearing number
 *   for "does this device come back".
 * @param linkChangeProbeMs after a link change is detected, how long a session gets to prove it
 *   still carries traffic before it is treated as a casualty of the roam and reaped.
 * @param callDisconnectGraceMs how long a call may sit in ICE `Disconnected` before it is
 *   declared lost. Sized to cover an ICE restart, which must in turn wait for signaling to come
 *   back on the new AP.
 * @param callConnectTimeoutMs ceiling on a call's CONNECTING phase.
 * @param callStatsIntervalMs `getStats()` sampling period. Also the adaptive governor's tick, so
 *   a slower sample makes the governor correspondingly slower to react.
 * @param iceRestartMinIntervalMs floor on the gap between two ICE restart attempts, so a link
 *   that flaps cannot turn into an offer/answer storm.
 * @param reconnectBaseMs first delay of the dialer's reconnect backoff. The same 1 s at every tier;
 *   the connection mode changes it (PC5: ECO 2 s, BOOST 250 ms). The accepting side's backup loop
 *   keeps its own larger floor.
