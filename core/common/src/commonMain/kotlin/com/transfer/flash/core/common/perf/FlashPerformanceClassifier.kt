/**
 * Resolves a [FlashDeviceProfile] to a tier (ERROR-033) — the "detect automatically on first
 * run" half of the performance-mode feature.
 *
 * ## Shape of the rules
 *
 * Two stages, in this order:
 *
 * 1. **Hard gates to [FlashPerformanceMode.LOW].** Any single one of these is conclusive: a
 *    wearable, the platform's own low-RAM flag, RAM or a display below what a modern phone has,
 *    an OS too old, or a CPU too narrow. These are the facts that make the *default* stack fail
 *    rather than merely strain.
 * 2. **Concern counting for [FlashPerformanceMode.MEDIUM].** Everything else is a weak signal, so
 *    no single one demotes: it takes [MEDIUM_CONCERN_THRESHOLD] of them. This asymmetry is
 *    deliberate and is the one judgement call worth stating outright — MEDIUM disables animation,
 *    so misclassifying a device that was working perfectly well is a visible regression for its
 *    user. A conservative demotion rule costs a bit of headroom on a borderline device; an
 *    aggressive one strips the UI on hardware that never needed it.
 *
 * ## Calibration
 *
 * Anchored on the three devices in the field report. A BelFone SCP810 (2 GB, Android 8.1,
 * 480x640) is caught twice over by the RAM and display gates, which is intentional redundancy —
 * some OEM builds under-report `totalMem`. A Pixel 7 trips nothing. An Infinix in the 4 GB /
 * API 31 / 8-core / 5 GHz shape raises exactly one concern (RAM) and so stays on
 * [FlashPerformanceMode.HIGH], matching the report that it "worked fine".
 *
 * Unknown facts never count against a device. [FlashDeviceProfile.UNKNOWN_INT] is not small.
