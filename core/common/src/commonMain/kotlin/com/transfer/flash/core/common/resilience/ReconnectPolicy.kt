/**
 * Pure exponential-backoff-with-jitter reconnect policy (plan C4.2 / upgrade 1).
 *
 * Chosen jitter variant: **full jitter with a floor** —
 * `delay = base + random01 * (min(cap, base * 2^attempt) - base)`, i.e. the
 * AWS "Exponential Backoff and Jitter" Full-Jitter formula raised to a
 * `base` minimum. The floor guarantees a minimum spacing between attempts
 * (important for P2P, where an immediate retry after a socket failure is
 * always wasted work), while the random component de-synchronizes peers that
 * all observed the same Wi-Fi drop and would otherwise reconnect in a
 * thundering herd against the same access point / group owner.
 *
 * Why full (floored) jitter over decorrelated jitter: the AWS study found
 * full jitter achieves approximately the same completion time as decorrelated
 * jitter with noticeably less client work, and decorrelated's advantage only
 * appears under sustained server-side overload — a regime a phone-to-phone
 * P2P link rarely enters. Decorrelated also carries state (last sleep)
 * between attempts, which complicates deterministic testing for no measured
 * benefit here.

 *
 * Pure logic: randomness is injected ([random01]) so tests are deterministic;
 * give-up semantics are computed from caller-supplied elapsed time, never an
 * internal clock (`FlashTimeSource` lives in :core:common and is not visible
 * cross-module by test-design constraint).
