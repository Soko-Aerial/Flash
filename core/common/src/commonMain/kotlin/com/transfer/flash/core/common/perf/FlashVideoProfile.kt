/**
 * Camera capture and video-encode envelope for one [FlashPerformanceMode].
 *
 * ## Why capture size is a tier knob at all
 *
 * The stack already sheds video quality under load two independent ways: WebRTC's own
 * `MAINTAIN_FRAMERATE` degradation preference lowers resolution when congestion control or the
 * CPU quality-scaler says the target is unaffordable, and Flash's `CallQualityGovernor` trades
 * rungs of picture away to protect speech. Both act on the *encoder*, and both are reactive.
 *
 * Neither helps the device this tiering exists for, because on that device the expensive part
 * happens **before** the encoder: `getUserMedia` opens the camera at the requested size, the
 * capturer delivers frames at that size, and every frame is scaled and colour-converted on the
 * CPU on its way in. A 2 GB handset asked for 1920x1080 at 30 fps pays for 62 Mpixel/s of
 * capture-side work whether or not a single byte of it survives the encoder's decision to send
 * 360p. Capping the *request* is the only way to not pay it — and it costs nothing visually
 * here, because that handset's own display is 480x640.
 *
 * So the ladder is: this profile sets the ceiling, and the two adaptive mechanisms operate
 * underneath it exactly as before.
 *
 * @param captureWidth requested capture width in pixels. The camera enumerator snaps this to
 *   the nearest format the hardware actually offers, so an unusual value degrades rather than
 *   fails.
 * @param captureHeight requested capture height in pixels.
 * @param captureFps requested capture frame rate, and the sender's `maxFramerate`.
 * @param maxBitrateKbps sender ceiling and `x-google-max-bitrate`. Congestion control stays
 *   free to use less.
 * @param minBitrateKbps the floor at which the encoder stops lowering bitrate and starts
 *   lowering resolution instead.
 * @param startBitrateKbps seeds the bandwidth estimate (`x-google-start-bitrate`) so the first
 *   second of a call is not a smear. Deliberately below [maxBitrateKbps]: the opening burst is
 *   shared with the voice stream it is supposed to leave room for.
