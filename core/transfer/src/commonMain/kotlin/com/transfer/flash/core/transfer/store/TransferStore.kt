/**
 * Storage port **owned by the transfer module** (Phase 4 dependency inversion, ADR-024).
 *
 * Captures exactly the persistence operations [com.transfer.flash.core.transfer.RealFlashTransferRepository]
 * performs — no more — so `core:transfer` has **zero** compile dependency on Room / SQLCipher.
 * A concrete adapter (e.g. `core:engine`'s `RoomTransferStore`) implements it against the real DB.
 *
 * Nullable at every call site: a `null` store means "run without persistence" — transfers still
 * work, only *resume-across-restart* is disabled (the pre-existing DB-less behavior). Methods are
 * `suspend`; the repository already calls them from coroutine contexts.
