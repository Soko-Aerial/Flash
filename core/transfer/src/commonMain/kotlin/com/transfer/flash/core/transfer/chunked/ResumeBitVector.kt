/**
 * Persistent per-transfer record of which chunk indexes have been received (and hash-verified),
 * the resume state primitive for C5.6.
 *
 * ## Merge rule (`reconcile`) — monotonic union
 *
 * [reconcile] performs a **union**: an index is "done" if either side reported it done. This is
 * the correct merge for every consumer of this class:
 *
 * - **Receiver-side view:** progress only grows — a chunk once verified on disk can never become
 *   un-verified, so union with any later report cannot regress state.
 * - **Sender-side mirror of receiver progress (ACK reconciliation):** `ACK_BATCH.indexes` are
 *   authoritative facts emitted by the receiver after hash verification; unioning them into the
 *   sender's confirmed-set mirrors how BitTorrent peers merge handshake `bitfield` + incremental
 *   `have` announcements, which are likewise monotonic grow-only sets
 *   (https://github.com/mgp/coding-in-the-real-world/blob/master/manuscript/bittorrent-client-case-study.md;
 *   https://atomashpolskiy.github.io/bt/javadoc/latest/bt/data/Bitfield.html).
 * - **Reconcile-on-reconnect (C5.6):** the sender asks the receiver for its done-set and unions
 *   it with the locally persisted mirror before resuming at the first hole.
 *
 * ## Serialization format (compact bit-vector)
 *
 * `int32 LE wordCount` followed by `wordCount` × 8 bytes, each 64-bit word written little-endian.
 * Bit `n` of the vector lives in word `n / 64`, bit value `1L shl (n % 64)`. **Trailing all-zero
 * words are not written**, so `wordCount` is `(highestSetBit / 64) + 1`, or 0 for an empty vector.
 * [fromSerialized] rejects words beyond the expected count and ignores/clears padding bits at or
 * above [totalChunks], so a hostile or stale payload can never resurrect chunks that do not belong
 * to the transfer.
 *
 * ## Phase 13B-3c: `java.util.BitSet` → a [LongArray] bitset
 *
 * The backing store was `java.util.BitSet`, packed for serialization via `BitSet.toLongArray()`.
 * That is the only `java.*` this file ever used, and the words it produced were already the wire
 * format — so the replacement is the `LongArray` itself, with the bit arithmetic that `BitSet` was
 * doing written out. Three of `BitSet`'s behaviours are load-bearing here and are reproduced
 * deliberately rather than incidentally:
 *
 * - **`toLongArray()` trims trailing zero words.** Its length is `ceil(length() / 64)`, where
 *   `length()` is the highest set bit plus one — not the capacity. A fixed-size dump would emit a
 *   longer array for the same set of bits and change every serialized payload, so
 *   [significantWordCount] reproduces the trim. This is what the golden vectors in
 *   `ResumeBitVectorTest` exist to pin.
 * - **`cardinality()` is a population count**, here `Long.countOneBits()` per word. It WAS a computed property
 *   (a full pass per read), which made `isComplete()` cost one pass per received chunk: a 100 GB file at 64 KiB
 *   chunks is 25 000 words, so about 4e10 word reads over the transfer (sweep R-07, 2026-10-09). It is now a counter
 *   kept by the three mutators and recomputed once by [fromSerialized], the only place that writes words wholesale;
 *   `ResumeBitVectorTest` checks the counter against a fresh popcount after random operations.
 * - **`nextSetBit` skips empty words.** [doneIndexes] keeps that complexity with
 *   `countTrailingZeroBits()` and the `w and (w - 1)` lowest-set-bit clear, so a mostly-empty
 *   vector over a million chunks still costs one pass over 15,625 words and not a million bit
 *   tests. [missingIndexes] was already O(totalChunks) by nature and is unchanged in shape.
 *
 * `BitSet(totalChunks)` was a capacity *hint* that grew on demand; the [LongArray] is exactly
 * `ceil(totalChunks / 64)` words and cannot grow. Nothing is lost, because every mutator already
 * bounds-checks against `[0, totalChunks)`: [markReceived] throws, [reconcile] filters silently,
 * and [fromSerialized] masks. The wire format did not change — no field, no order, no width, no
 * endianness — and the layout paragraph above is the text that was there before.
