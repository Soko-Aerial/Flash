 * because [ChunkStream] depended on `ChunkFrame` — and re-typed `open()` from `java.io.InputStream`
 * to [okio.Source]. That single type change is what made the send side of the transfer pipeline
 * expressible in common code at all. `Chunker.kt` itself followed in 13B-3e, at which point the
 * `.buffer().inputStream()` bridges that adapted this interface back to `java.io` disappeared and
 * [ChunkStream] began reading an `okio.BufferedSource` directly.
