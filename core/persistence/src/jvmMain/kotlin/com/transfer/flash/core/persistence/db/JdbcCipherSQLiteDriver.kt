/**
 * The encrypted, file-backed JVM driver — **09B-2**, and the artifact D5 = C was blocked on.
 *
 * PHASE-09B's amendment 8 records that `jvmMain` was never created for this module, and that the
 * only thing missing for desktop persistence was "an encrypted, file-backed JVM driver"
 * (`BundledSQLiteDriver` is unencrypted and is confined to `:memory:` in `jvmTest` by that phase's
 * charter). This is it.
 *
 * ## Why this driver
 *
 * `io.github.willena:sqlite-jdbc` — *"SQLite JDBC library with encryption and authentication
 * support"* (a fork of xerial's driver, `sqlite-jdbc-crypt`, Apache-2.0). The human answered D5's
 * three sub-questions on 2026-09-14: this driver, OSS-only (ruling out Zetetic's commercial
 * SQLCipher), and **no** file-format parity with Android required. Encryption itself was never
 * negotiable — `DECISIONS.md` forbids "B without C" — and this driver encrypts.
 *
 * ## What it does *not* give you
 *
 * **Not SQLCipher-compatible.** The fork encrypts via Utelle's SQLite3MultipleCiphers with a
 * selectable cipher, whereas Android uses Zetetic's SQLCipher. A desktop `.db` cannot be opened by
 * the Android build, or vice versa. That is a recorded, deliberate consequence of the third answer,
 * not an oversight: stores are per-device and are never transferred between them.
 *
 * ## Threading
 *
 * `hasConnectionPool` is left at its `false` default: each [open] returns a fresh JDBC connection
 * and nothing here is pooled. That is the signal Room uses to manage connections externally, which
 * is what we want — Room's `setQueryCoroutineContext` serialises access, and a half-hearted internal
 * pool would be worse than none.
