/**
 * Outbox drain semantics (invariants encoded in C1.8 and relied on by C6):
 * 1. claim = read via [dueForDelivery] + atomic [incrementAttempts] per claimed row;
 * 2. delivery commit = [delete], driven by the peer's `DeliveryReceipt` — **not** by a successful
 *    socket write. A write into a half-open socket succeeds, so committing on it lost the frame for
 *    good (ERROR-031); a written-but-unacknowledged row instead stays claimed and is resent on the
 *    caller's backoff ladder until the receipt arrives or the wall-clock budget expires;
 * 3. re-claiming after delete yields nothing — no double delivery. Before the delete a resend is
 *    possible and safe: the receiver's insert is idempotent and it re-acks replays.
