/**
 * A push-to-talk ping carried by the chat transport (v1, 2026-09-09).
 *
 * A single press of a hardware PTT button fans one of these out to every paired + online
 * peer. Fire-and-forget: no outbox row, no retry, no persistence. Receivers deduplicate on
 * [eventId] and surface a tone + notification; there is deliberately no chat-row write in v1.
 *
 * Standalone on purpose: it is NOT a [MessageWireFrame] subtype, so both hosts' exhaustive
 * `when` expressions over [MessageWireFrame] keep compiling untouched.
