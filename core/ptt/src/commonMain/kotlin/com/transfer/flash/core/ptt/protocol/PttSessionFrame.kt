/**
 * Push-to-talk voice-session control frames (ADR-032, Phase 0).
 *
 * One floor holder transmits; every other member only receives (strict half-duplex), so
 * receivers never capture and the transmitter never plays. Audio itself travels as binary
 * frames (Phase 1); these text frames carry session lifecycle + heartbeat only.
 *
 * Standalone on purpose like [PttPingFrame]: NOT a [MessageWireFrame] subtype, so both
 * hosts' exhaustive `when` expressions over [MessageWireFrame] keep compiling untouched.
 * Every frame carries [sessionId] + [from] so receivers can bind it to the authenticated
 * transport peer and ignore stale/retired sessions.
