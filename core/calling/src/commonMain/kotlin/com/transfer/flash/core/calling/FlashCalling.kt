/**
 * Public voice/video calling contract (ADR-025) — the calling counterpart of `FlashDiscovery`
 * and `FlashNetwork`.
 *
 * Owns at most one live call at a time. A second inbound invite while a call is live is
 * auto-declined "busy" rather than queued, so a caller's UI never hangs on DIALING.
 *
 * Calling is **not** part of the `FlashEngine` facade: it needs a signaling channel the host
 * already owns, plus runtime microphone/camera permissions and a foreground service that only an
 * app can declare. Consumers therefore depend on `core-calling` directly and wire two
 * host-supplied seams:
 *
 *  - **outbound** — every frame this contract emits is handed to the host's `sendFrame` lambda,
 *    which is expected to deliver it to a specific peer over an already-established session.
 *  - **inbound** — the host passes every received text frame to [onInboundText], which returns
 *    true when the text was a call frame it consumed.
 *
 * Signaling is plain text (`FLASH_CALL|…`, see `docs/protocol.md`), so any duplex text transport
 * works — the Flash WebSocket mesh is simply the one the app happens to use.
 *
 * All suspend operations are safe to call from the main dispatcher; they hand off internally.
