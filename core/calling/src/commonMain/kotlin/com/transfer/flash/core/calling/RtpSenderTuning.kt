/**
 * Platform-neutral sender-tuning payloads — the Phase 25 S2e seam.
 *
 * The session classes' quality logic (voice-first ordering, tier ceilings, the concession
 * ladder) is pure policy and lives in commonMain. What it drives, however, is knobs only the
 * native layer exposes, and the two backends expose DIFFERENT knobs:
 *
 * - Android reaches through `RtpSender.android` to `org.webrtc.RTCRtpEncodingParameters`,
 *   which has `networkPriority`, `bitratePriority` and `degradationPreference`.
 * - Desktop reaches through `RtpSender.native` to `dev.onvoid.webrtc.RTCRtpEncodingParameters`
 *   (webrtc-java 0.17.0), which has the bitrate/framerate/scale/active fields but NO pacer
 *   priority and NO degradation preference.
 *
 * So the sessions build these payloads and the `expect` extensions below apply them; each
 * actual maps what its backend supports and logs — never silently drops — what it cannot.
 * A missing knob costs quality tuning, not correctness: every call site is best-effort by
 * design (a tuning failure costs bitrate or priority, not the call).
