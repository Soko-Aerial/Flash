 * How much video is currently being given up so that voice stays intelligible (D8, ADR-025).

 * A ladder, cheapest concession first. [CallQualityGovernor] walks it one rung at a time so a
 * transient burst of jitter costs a little bitrate rather than the whole camera, and a genuinely
 * unusable link ends up sending audio only.
 *
 * Why video is the thing that gives: on the networks Flash actually runs on — a phone hotspot,
 * half-duplex, shared with whatever else is associated to it — video is one to two orders of
 * magnitude more expensive than voice. A 32 kbit/s Opus stream fits in the gaps of almost any
 * link; 2.5 Mbit/s of 1080p does not, and when the two compete inside one bandwidth estimate the
 * loser is whichever the allocator was not told to protect.
