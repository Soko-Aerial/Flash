/**
 * One 1:1 WebRTC call session (C7, ADR-025).
 *
 * Owns the [PeerConnection], local media (getUserMedia), the SDP/ICE exchange, and the
 * call state machine. Signaling frames are sent through [sendFrame] (host wires this to
 * the WS mesh) and delivered inbound through [onInboundFrame].
 *
 * The session is single-use: once [state] reaches [FlashCallState.ENDED] it cannot be
 * restarted; the host creates a new session per call.
 *
 * Media transport: WebRTC with EMPTY iceServers — Flash is LAN/hotspot-only, host
 * candidates connect on-link (ADR-025). No STUN/TURN.
 *
 * Verified against webrtc-kmp 0.125.11 commonMain/androidMain sources:
 * - `signalingState` is a plain property (not a Flow).
 * - `addTrack(track, vararg streams: MediaStream)`.
 * - `onTrack` emits [com.shepeliev.webrtckmp.TrackEvent] (track + streams list).
 * - `createOffer/createAnswer(options)` require [OfferAnswerOptions].
 * - SDP types are [SessionDescriptionType] (no "SdpType" in 0.125.11).
 * - `IceCandidate(sdpMid: String, ...)` — mid is non-null on the wire ("" when absent).
 * - `VideoStreamTrack.switchCamera()` is suspend.
 * - Permissions are checked at getUserMedia time (throws on missing).

     * Gives voice priority over video inside the bandwidth allocator (D8).
     *
     * The answer to "is audio prioritised over video in a video call?" used to be **no**: this
     * sender did not exist, because `pc.addTrack(audio, stream)`'s return value was discarded.
     * Video got a degradation preference, a ceiling and a floor; audio got whatever was left
     * over, which on a congested hotspot is nothing.
     *
     * Two knobs, and they are not the same knob:
     * - `networkPriority` = [Priority.HIGH] is the *pacer's* ordering — which queue drains first
     *   when the send window is short.
     * - `bitratePriority` is the *allocator's* weight — how the estimated bandwidth is divided
     *   between the two streams before either of them is paced at all.
     *
     * Setting only one of them is the trap: a high pacing priority on a stream that was never
     * allocated any bandwidth changes nothing, and a large allocation share that queues behind a
     * 2.5 Mbit/s video burst still arrives late.
     *
     * DSCP is deliberately absent. [BundlePolicy.MaxBundle] plus [RtcpMuxPolicy.Require] means
     * audio and video share ONE 5-tuple, so any DiffServ marking would apply to both streams
     * identically and mark nothing apart — the priority has to be expressed where the two
     * streams are still distinguishable, which is the allocator, not the IP header.
     *
     * The audio ceiling is a ceiling, not a target: Opus with in-band FEC (see [CallSdp]) is
     * already transparent for speech well below it, and capping it stops a generous bandwidth
     * estimate from handing voice bitrate it cannot use. It comes from
     * [com.transfer.flash.core.common.perf.FlashVoiceProfile] so it drops with the tier — 16 kbit/s
     * on LOW, where the packet *rate* has been cut too and the two savings compound.
     *
     * Best-effort, like [tuneVideoSender]: a failure here costs priority, not the call.

     * target is unaffordable, WebRTC drops **resolution** (1080p → 720p → 540p → …) and
     * keeps the frame rate, which is what a moving talking head needs. The default,

     *
     * Without a bitrate ceiling this is academic: libwebrtc caps a VP8 stream around 2.5 Mbit/s
     * from its internal codec table, which starves 1080p no matter what the link can carry. The
     * ceiling, the floor and the frame-rate cap all come from [FlashVideoProfile], so on LOW this

     * still lets video take its share first and leave voice to fit in the remainder, which is
     * how a 32 kbit/s stream ends up unintelligible next to a picture that looks fine.
     *
     * Reaches through [RtpSender.android] because webrtc-kmp's own `RtpParameters` wrapper
