/**
 * One-shot WebRTC engine setup: installs a low-latency audio device module (ADR-025) whose
 * capture source has been *proven* to deliver frames on this device (ERROR-032).
 *
 * webrtc-kmp builds its `PeerConnectionFactory` lazily and never sets an audio device
 * module, so libwebrtc creates a default `JavaAudioDeviceModule` on first use — and that
 * default has `useLowLatency = false`, i.e. `AudioStreamTrack` runs in the normal performance
 * mode with the standard output buffer. On the playout path that is tens of milliseconds
 * of buffering that nothing else in the stack can claw back: it is upstream of the jitter
 * buffer, upstream of the decoder, and not reachable from any per-call API.
 *
 * [configureOnce] is the only window to change it. `WebRtc.configure` builds the factory
 * immediately and throws if a factory already exists, so this must run before the first
 * `MediaDevices`/`PeerConnection` touch — in practice, at engine construction, long before
 * a call exists. That one-shot nature is also why the capture source is decided *here*
 * rather than per call: the ADM is process-wide and permanent once the factory exists.
 *
 * ### Why the capture source is probed (ERROR-032)
 *
 * `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` is the right default: it is what routes the mic through the
 * platform's echo-cancellation path, and it is what the hardware AEC/NS effects attach to.
 * But it is a *request*, not a contract. On some OEM audio HALs — rugged/PTT handsets in
 * particular, which carry a vendor radio stack on the voice path — the source opens
 * cleanly, `AudioRecord.getState()` reports INITIALIZED, libwebrtc's own
 * `verifyAudioConfig` passes against `TYPE_BUILTIN_MIC`, and then `read()` never returns a
 * single frame. There is no exception and no error callback; the far end simply hears
 * silence. Measured on a BelFone SCP810 (Android 8.1, qcom): capture stalls inside the HAL
 * until libwebrtc's `stopThread()` gives up on its 2 s join, and the blocking
 * `stop()`/`read()` that follow stall the process long enough to ANR it.
 *
 * So [configureOnce] opens the mic once, briefly, and keeps the first source the HAL actually
 * streams frames on: `VOICE_COMMUNICATION`, then `MIC`, then `DEFAULT`. The winner is cached in
 * `SharedPreferences`, so this costs one sub-second mic touch on the first launch and nothing
 * afterwards. The test is *frame delivery*, never loudness — see [deliversAudio] for why that
 * distinction is the difference between a probe that works and a probe that is a coin flip.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating:
 *
 * - **Hardware AEC/NS are only enabled for `VOICE_COMMUNICATION`.** On a raw `MIC` fallback
 *   there is no platform echo-cancellation path to attach them to, and stacking them on one
 *   anyway is the well-known way to get a capture stream that is present but useless.
 *   libwebrtc's software APM handles AEC/NS on the fallback instead.
 * - **The probe needs `RECORD_AUDIO`.** At engine construction the grant may not exist yet,
 *   in which case the probe is skipped, nothing is cached, and `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` is used
 *   as before. A device that both prompts for the mic *and* needs the fallback therefore
 *   gets it from the next process start, not the first call.
 *
 * Everything else here is the default made explicit and pinned: voice-communication audio
 * attributes on the output track, and libwebrtc's volume logger disabled — a 30 s polling
 * timer that exists only to write log lines.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a device whose native library or ADM refuses to initialise still
 * gets a working call on libwebrtc's defaults.
