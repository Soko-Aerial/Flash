/**
 * Multi-radio discovery facade (plan C3.9). Implements the existing
 * [FlashDiscovery] interface on top of N [FlashRadioTransport]s.
 *
 * Architecture (research-backed, see logs/experiments.md EXP entries + plan C3):
 *
 * **Event log + snapshot pattern.** All transports' events are merged into one
 * [mergedEvents] [SharedFlow] while [discoveredEndpoints] is a [StateFlow]
 * rebuilt from the per-transport [EndpointDirectory]s on every diff. This split
 * is deliberate: StateFlow conflates updates by equality (kotlinx docs,
 * https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-state-flow/),
 * so pushing discrete Found/Updated/Lost *events* through a StateFlow would
 * silently drop intermediate transitions for slow collectors — e.g., a
 * Found followed quickly by Lost could collapse and consumers would never see
 * either. Snapshots, by contrast, are idempotent full-state values where
 * conflation is exactly the desired behavior. Hence: events → SharedFlow with
 * extra buffering and DROP_OLDEST overflow (slow UI consumers lose the oldest
 * cosmetic events rather than blocking radio threads or crashing with
 * BufferOverflowException); state → StateFlow.
 *
 * **Cross-radio dedup by deviceId.** One directory per transport keeps
 * per-radio truth; the global endpoint list collapses peers seen on multiple
 * radios into ONE endpoint reported via the highest-priority transport:
 * `LAN > WIFI_DIRECT > WIFI_AWARE > BLE`. Priority rationale: Android's own
 * connectivity stack scores/ranks networks by transport policy
 * (https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/network-selection) and treats
 * transports as capabilities ranked per request
 * (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/NetworkCapabilities);
 * Nearby Connections exposes explicit strategy choices trading bandwidth vs
 * topology (https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/nearby/connection/Strategy).
 * LAN wins because it offers the highest sustained throughput through the AP
 * infrastructure; Wi-Fi Direct next (direct P2P, no AP needed but slower in
 * practice per our own benchmarks); Wi-Fi Aware after (higher throughput than
 * BLE across longer range — https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/wifi/wifi-aware);
 * BLE last as a presence-only signal (plan C3.8). Unknown transport names rank
 * below all known ones.
 *
 * **Hysteresis on loss.** When the highest-priority transport reports a peer
 * Lost while the same deviceId is still alive in a lower-priority directory,
 * the composite does NOT emit Lost; it emits Updated carrying the fallback
 * endpoint. Rationale: "peer gone" would be factually wrong (the peer is still
 * reachable), and flapping the UI between Lost/Found as radios disagree is
 * worse than briefly reporting a slower path. A real Lost is emitted only when
 * the last sighting disappears (radio goodbye or sweeper aging).
 *
 * **Presence sweeping (plan C3.5).** Radios miss goodbye packets routinely —
 * mDNS goodbyes are TTL=0 records (RFC 6762 §10.1,
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-10.1) that many stacks
 * never send on crash/kill, forcing waiters to fall back to record expiry:
 * 120 s for SRV/A/AAAA records, 75 min for PTR/TXT
 * (RFC 6762 §10; https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762#section-10).
 * Waiting out even the 120 s SRV TTL is far too slow for chat-style presence.
 * Default grace of 30 s matches plan C3.5's example: short enough that peer
 * departure converges within half a minute, long enough to ride out single
 * missed re-announcements without flapping during brief Wi-Fi drops. Callers
 * drive [sweep] periodically with explicit timestamps (pure logic, testable).
 *
 * Threading: event handling mutates internal maps under a lock; flows are
 * thread-safe. Collectors are launched lazily into an injected scope so tests
 * can supply a synchronous dispatcher for deterministic assertions.
