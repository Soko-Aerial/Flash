/**
 * Peer discovery by self-announcing UDP multicast — the second LAN transport, running ALONGSIDE the
 * DNS-SD ones (`NsdTransport` on Android, `JmdsTransport` on the desktop), never in place of them.
 *
 * ## Why this exists next to a working mDNS transport
 *
 * NSD/JmDNS work. What they cannot do is tell the difference between "this peer published no
 * attributes" and "this peer's attributes have not reached my resolver cache yet", and they cannot
 * expire a peer that died without saying goodbye:
 *
 * - JmDNS 3.5.12 hands back a hollow `ServiceInfo` (`txtKeys=[] txtBytes=1`) when the TXT has not
 *   been cached yet, so a peer resolves with a correct address and NO `device_id` — measured against
 *   the desktop's own record, and again against the phone's on 2026-09-14, where it left the desktop
 *   unable to build an endpoint for the phone and therefore never dialing it.
 * - mDNS has no periodic positive signal. A peer that is killed sends no goodbye, so its records sit
 *   in every neighbour's cache until their TTL expires — an hour with JmDNS's default — and the only
 *   thing a transport can do about it is guess.
 *
 * This transport has neither problem, because it defines its own liveness:
 *
 * - **Discovery is one datagram that carries the whole peer** — identity (the shared `TxtCodec`
 *   vocabulary) plus its server port — and **the peer's address is the datagram's source**, so
 *   there is no resolution step to fail or to go stale.
 * - **Every peer re-announces on a cadence**, so a lease bounds a peer's life. A live peer renews it;
 *   a dead one stops existing after [peerLeaseMs] (`Lost`), with no dependence on anyone sending a
 *   goodbye or on a resolver's cache expiring. The `Presence` heartbeat this emits is therefore a
 *   *positive* signal backed by a fresh datagram, not an assertion from the absence of bad news.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * Implements [FlashRadioTransport] like any other radio, so [com.transfer.flash.core.discovery.core.CompositeDiscovery]
 * merges it with the DNS-SD transports and dedups by device id. When both transports see a peer the
 * composite keeps one endpoint (same address, same port, same device id) and its loss hysteresis
 * means whichever transport reports the peer first wins the right to keep it visible — so adding this
 * transport cannot make a peer that NSD already sees disappear.

     * `startBrowsing` returns a bind failure, because `CompositeDiscovery.startAll` aggregates every

     * boot — `check(...)` in the app's `DiscoveryEngineHolder`, and the desktop engine's equivalent.
     * A host can legitimately have no usable interface at boot: Wi-Fi off, cellular only, a VPN
     * holding the default route, an adapter still coming up. This transport runs ALONGSIDE the
     * DNS-SD pair rather than instead of them, so it must never be the reason a stack that worked
     * yesterday refuses to start today.
     *
     * The two directions are not symmetric, which is why the tolerant one wins: here the receive
     * loops simply have no sockets to read for a while, whereas the strict direction is an app that
     * will not start because a radio was off.
     *
     * Nothing external has to notice the recovery: a phone whose Wi-Fi was off at boot starts
     * hearing peers the moment an interface exists. Cheap while it keeps failing — with no candidate
     * interface the attempt is an enumeration that returns nothing.
