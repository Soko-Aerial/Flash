/**
 * Wire format of the UDP-multicast announcement (see [MulticastTransport]).
 *
 * One datagram carries the WHOLE peer: identity keys (the same `TxtCodec` vocabulary every other
 * radio uses), the peer's Flash protocol version, and the port its WebSocket server listens on. That
 * is the entire point of this transport — there is no second resolution step whose failure can
 * strand a peer:
 *
 * - **The address is the datagram's source IP.** Nothing to resolve, so nothing to go stale.
 * - **The identity is in the payload**, not in a record some resolver may not have cached yet. The
 *   failure this avoids is concrete: on 2026-09-13/14 the desktop resolved the phone's DNS-SD
 *   record as a hollow `ServiceInfo` (`txtKeys=[] txtBytes=1`, JmDNS 3.5.12's `EMPTY_TXT`), had no
 *   `device_id` to build an endpoint from, and therefore never dialed it — while the phone could see
 *   the desktop perfectly. There is no equivalent state here: a datagram either arrives complete or
 *   not at all.
 *
 * Format is one [FlashTextFraming] line, so escaping (`%20`/`%3D`/`%25`) is the vocabulary the rest
 * of the project already uses for peer-controlled text:
 *
 * ```text
 * FLASH_MCAST v=1 device_id=<uuid> name=<escaped> model=<escaped> proto=2 port=45822 [caps=kiosk] [fp8=ab12cd34]
 * ```
 *
 * Forward compatibility: unknown keys are ignored, and a datagram whose [KEY_FORMAT] is not
 * [FORMAT_VERSION] is rejected rather than misread — the format version is what lets this evolve
 * without breaking a peer that has not been updated.
