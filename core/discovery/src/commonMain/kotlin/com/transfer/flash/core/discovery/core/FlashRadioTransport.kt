 * Wi-Fi Aware publish extras later. [deviceModel] feeds the Nearby tab rows;
 * [protocolVersion] lets peers hide incompatible versions pre-connection.
 *
 * P3.5 additions (both defaulted so existing callers compile unchanged):
 * - [capabilities]: capability flags advertised via TXT `caps` (e.g. `kiosk`
 *   willingness from RECEIVE_KIOSK mode). INFORMATIONAL ONLY on the wire —
 *   mDNS/DNS-SD is unauthenticated (RFC 6762), so advertised caps are a hint,
 *   never an access decision; enforcement happens at connect time (C3.10 seam).
 * - [fingerprintPrefix]: first 8 hex chars of this device's identity
 *   fingerprint (C2.3). May be absent until pairing lands; peers use it as a
 *   pre-connection consistency cross-check only (see zeroconf spoofing threat
 *   model in docs/security notes / plan P3.5 research).
