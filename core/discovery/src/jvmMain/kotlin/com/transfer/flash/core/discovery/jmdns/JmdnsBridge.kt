 * `javax.jmdns.*`. That is what makes [JmdnsTransport] unit-testable on a CI box with no
 * multicast — a fake bridge records calls and replays callbacks.
 *
 * `public` for the same reason `NsdManagerBridge` is: the two radio bridges are siblings and
 * their ABIs stay symmetric, so a downstream consumer can supply its own implementation.
 *
 * Not thread-safe on its own. [JmdnsTransport] serialises every call through its own lock;
 * JmDNS's own callback threads only ever enter through [JmdnsBrowseEvents].

     * process does not say goodbye: a clean shutdown runs `unregisterAllServices()`, whose Canceler
     * sends the TTL=0 announcement, but a killed JVM sends nothing and every peer keeps the record
     * until its TTL expires. JmDNS's default is `DNSConstants.DNS_TTL =
     * Integer.getInteger("net.dns.ttl", 60 * 60)` — **one hour** — so a `Terminate batch job` left
     * the phone listing a desktop that was not running for up to that long, and it was twice
     * diagnosed as a code defect (see the pairing gate runbook's ghost warning).
     *
     * **Why shortening it is safe.** `JmDNSImpl` starts a `Renewer` per registered service that
     * re-announces every record at `ANNOUNCED_RENEWAL_TTL_INTERVAL = DNS_TTL * 500` ms — exactly
     * half the TTL (`Renewer.java:55`) — and Bonjour's cache maintenance re-queries ahead of expiry
     * for records with an active browse client. Both paths refresh a live advertiser, so the only
     * cache that ever reaches expiry is one whose advertiser is gone, which is the whole point.
     *
     * The property must be set before `DNSConstants` initialises, because the TTL is read once into
     * a static field; this function is the first statement of [open] and nothing in this process
     * touches `javax.jmdns` earlier. An operator-supplied `-Dnet.dns.ttl=` still wins.
