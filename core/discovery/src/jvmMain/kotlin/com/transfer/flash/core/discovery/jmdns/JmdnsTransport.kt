/**
 * Desktop-side TXT codec. Encode DELEGATES to the shared [TxtCodec] in `commonMain` so the wire
 * format has exactly one size-guarded encoder (R8: `TxtCodec` is called, never modified).
 *
 * Decode is an independent TOLERANT parser, byte-for-byte the same contract as `androidMain`'s
 * `NsdTxtCodec.decode`: a missing `name` falls back to the service name, a missing `proto` falls
 * back to our version, and missing `caps`/`fp8` degrade to `emptySet`/null. The shared
 * [TxtCodec.decode] is STRICT — it returns null when `proto` is absent — so using it here would
 * make the desktop hide pre-P3.5 advertisers that Android shows. Phase 16 tests desktop↔Android
 * parity, so the two decoders must agree.
 *
 * Duplicated rather than hoisted for the same reason `PlatformLock` is duplicated per module
 * (CONVENTIONS R2): `NsdTxtCodec` is `internal` in `androidMain`, and `androidMain`/`jvmMain` are
 * siblings with no `dependsOn` edge, so `jvmMain` cannot see it. Hoisting the tolerant decoder
 * into `commonMain` would additionally mean editing an `androidMain` file, which PHASE-14
 * forbids. Logged under Known issues.

/**
 * Desktop mDNS/DNS-SD [FlashRadioTransport], the `jvmMain` counterpart of `androidMain`'s
 * `NsdTransport`. Advertises `_flash-transfer._tcp.` and browses for it continuously, so a
 * desktop and an Android device on the same LAN see each other with no configuration (the
 * Phase 16 gate).
 *
 * ### Contract obligations this class honours, and why each is NOT optional
 *
 * PHASE-14's "Do NOT" list says to add no presence detection and no event deduplication, and its
 * sample class emits neither [FlashTransportEvent.Presence] nor
 * [FlashTransportEvent.StateChanged] and overrides no [restartBrowsing]. Measuring the actual
 * consumer shows all three are load-bearing, so all three are implemented and the deviations are
 * recorded in the phase log:
 *
 * - **Presence.** `FlashTransportEvent.Presence`'s KDoc: *"Emitting this is MANDATORY for any
 *   transport whose consumer ages peers out on a TTL."* `CompositeDiscovery` runs an internal
 *   sweeper every `DEFAULT_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` (5 s) that evicts anything unseen for
 *   `DEFAULT_GRACE_MS` (30 s). A transport that only ever emits `Found` therefore loses every
 *   peer ~30 s in and never recovers it — the exact field-reported bug that put the `Presence`
 *   variant in the interface.
 * - **restartBrowsing.** `CompositeDiscovery.watchdogBrowsing()` calls
 *   `transport.restartBrowsing()` for a transport stalled ≥ `DEFAULT_BROWSE_WATCHDOG_MS`. The
 *   interface default delegates to `startBrowsing()`, which returns early while `browsing` is
 *   true — so without an override the watchdog is a silent no-op and a responder killed by a
 *   Wi-Fi↔hotspot switch never comes back.
 * - **StateChanged.** It is the ONLY input to `CompositeDiscovery.applyBrowseState()`, which sets
 *   both `state.isDiscovering` and the stall stamps the watchdog reads. No `StateChanged` means
 *   the watchdog above can never fire in the first place.
 *
 * Adding them is not "also fixing things" (R1): a transport that omits them does not satisfy
 * [FlashRadioTransport], and R2 forbids stubbing to force a compile.
 *
 * ### Deliberate differences from `NsdTransport`
 *
 * - **No multicast lock, no API-level split, no connectivity callback.** Those are Android
 *   platform concerns; JmDNS owns its own sockets and there is no desktop equivalent.
 * - **ECO duty-cycling is not implemented.** [setMode] honours the advertise toggle (GHOST) and
 *   the restart-backoff base (BOOST) but browses continuously in every mode: the knob exists to
 *   spare a phone's battery, and `FlashRadioTransport.setMode` says implementations *should*
 *   honour duty cycle, not must. Documented rather than silently dropped.
 * - **`transportName` is `"jmdns"`**, mirroring the sibling's `"nsd"`. See the property KDoc.
