/**
 * Android implementation of [MulticastSocketFactory] (see [MulticastTransport]).
 *
 * Two platform obligations this file exists to satisfy, both of which fail silently when missed:
 *
 * - **The `WifiManager` multicast lock.** Without it the Wi-Fi chipset filters multicast frames in
 *   hardware while the socket still looks perfectly healthy — the app announces into the void and
 *   hears nobody. Acquired on bind and released when the transport tears its sockets down, so a
 *   stopped transport never holds a chipset-wide lock.
 * - **One socket per interface.** A single wildcard socket joins the group on whichever interface
 *   the routing table picks; on a phone with Wi-Fi plus tethering or a VPN that is not necessarily
 *   the one the peer is on, and the failure mode is total silence, not an error.
 *
 * Sockets are bound with `SO_REUSEADDR` set BEFORE the bind (hence the `MulticastSocket(null)`
 * dance): several sockets on one device share the announce port, one per interface, and a
 * constructor-bind would leave no window in which to set the flag.
