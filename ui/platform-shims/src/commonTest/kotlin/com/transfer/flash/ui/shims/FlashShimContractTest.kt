/**
 * The part of the shim surface a test can reach on **every** target.
 *
 * The seams themselves are `@Composable` factories, and this repo has no Compose UI-test harness, so
 * the actuals are exercised per-platform instead (`jvmTest` drives the desktop implementations
 * directly). What is left in common is the contract the two sides share: the data carried across the
 * picker seam, the tile decode budget, and the permission set both actuals must map. Each of these is
 * a value another module or actual depends on, so pinning them here is what makes a silent change
 * loud — R3.1's point that "an `actual` that is only compiled is not verified" applies to constants
 * shared across actuals just as much as to functions.
