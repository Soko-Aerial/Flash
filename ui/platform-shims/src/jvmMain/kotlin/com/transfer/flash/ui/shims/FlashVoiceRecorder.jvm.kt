/**
 * `javax.sound.sampled.TargetDataLine` capture, written out as a WAV.
 *
 * **Why WAV and not the `.m4a` Android produces.** The JDK ships no AAC encoder, and adding one is a
 * dependency decision (R10) with no human answer behind it yet. WAV is the format the platform can
 * actually write, and it is not a dead end: Android's `MediaPlayer` plays PCM WAV, so a note recorded
 * on desktop plays on a phone, and this module's own `jvm` [FlashAudioPlayer] plays it back locally.
 * The asymmetry is the other direction — a note recorded on Android is AAC, which desktop cannot decode.
 * That gap is recorded in [rememberFlashAudioPlayer]'s `jvm` actual and on the backlog.
 *
 * 44.1 kHz / 16-bit / mono matches the Android encoder's sampling rate and bit depth, so the waveform
 * amplitudes the composer draws are on the same scale on both platforms.
 *
 * Not thread-safe from the caller's side — drive it from the main thread, as on Android. Internally one
 * daemon thread drains the line; [maxAmplitude] reads across that boundary through an [AtomicInteger].
