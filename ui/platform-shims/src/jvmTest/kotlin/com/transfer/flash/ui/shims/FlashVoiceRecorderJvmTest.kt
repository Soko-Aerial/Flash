/**
 * The parts of the desktop voice recorder that need no microphone.
 *
 * Capture itself cannot be tested here — `AudioSystem.getLine` needs a real input device, and a CI box
 * has none, which is exactly why `start()` is written to return `false` rather than throw. What *is*
 * testable is the arithmetic the waveform is drawn from and the two lifecycle paths a user can reach
 * without ever recording: stopping something that never started, and cancelling a fresh recorder.
 *
 * [peakOf] was lifted out of `JvmVoiceRecorder.recordPeak` for this: it is pure, it is the one piece
 * of the file that can be silently wrong (sign extension and byte order both have plausible-looking
 * wrong answers), and reading it from a test must not require an open line.
