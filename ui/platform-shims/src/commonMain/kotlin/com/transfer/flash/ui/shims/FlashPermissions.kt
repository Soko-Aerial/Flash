 *
 * D7c words the seam as a bare `expect suspend fun ensurePermission(...)`. It cannot be one: the
 * Android implementation needs an `ActivityResultLauncher`, which only
 * `rememberLauncherForActivityResult` can produce and only from a composition. So the seam is a
 * `@Composable` factory returning a handle whose method is the `suspend fun` D7c describes — the same
 * shape Phase 18 had to use for `FlashThemeSwatches`, and for the same reason: the platform state
 * lives in the composition, not in a free function.
