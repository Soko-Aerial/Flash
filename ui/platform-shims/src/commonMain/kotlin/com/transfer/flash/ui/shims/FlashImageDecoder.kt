     * @param isVideo take a representative frame instead of decoding the bytes as a still.
     * @param maxLongEdge cap for the longer edge of the result, in pixels.
     * @param memoize false for one-off large decodes (the full-screen viewer) that would evict the
     *   whole thumbnail cache to store a single bitmap nobody will ask for twice.
     * @param lowColorDepth prefer a two-byte-per-pixel decode when the platform supports it. Android
     *   uses `RGB_565` for opaque stills below the HIGH performance tier; video is unchanged.
     * @param computeInSampleSize the power-of-two subsampling factor for a source of the given size.
     *   Passed in rather than computed here, and that is the whole reason this parameter exists:
     *   `:ui:chat`'s `FlashMediaViewerMath.computeInSampleSize` is the tested implementation, it is
     *   shared with the viewer's own zoom maths, and it lives in the module that *depends* on this
     *   one. Reaching for it from here would be a dependency cycle; copying it would fork a function
     *   whose test suite would then only cover one of the two copies.
