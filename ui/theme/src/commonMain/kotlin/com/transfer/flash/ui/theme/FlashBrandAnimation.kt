/**
 * The Flash brand animation — a reusable Composables port of `logo-claude/svg/flash-splash-loop.svg`.
 *
 * The bolt "breathes" and three discovery-pulse rings radiate outward on an **infinite,
 * un-timed loop**. It is the animated identity of branded loading/empty state surfaces (Bug 4
 * fix: the animation used to live inside `FlashSplashScreen` and could not be reused). It was
 * also the launch splash until UI-056 (ADR-080) replaced that with [FlashInkSplash].
 *
 * The caller decides when to stop by removing this composable — nothing here enforces a
 * minimum duration. `background = true` fills the canvas with the dark launch gradient
 * (the splash look); `background = false` draws just the centered bolt + rings so it can
 * be embedded at a smaller, non-full-bleed size (e.g. the transfers loading state).
 *
 * Always honors reduce-motion via [FlashTheme.motion]: when animations are disabled the
 * loop collapses to a static centered bolt at rest.
 *
 * Both animated values are read **inside the `Canvas` draw block**, never in composition — see
 * [rememberFlashBrandPhase]. This composable therefore does not recompose while it animates; each
 * frame only re-runs the draw lambda.
 *
 * @param modifier The drawing box. Pass `Modifier.fillMaxSize()` for the splash, or a
 *   explicit `Modifier.size(...)` for a compact embedded animation (the bolt/rings scale
 *   to the canvas box).
 * @param background Draws the dark vertical launch-gradient fill behind the animation.

/**
 * The animated bolt is an infinite loop; under reduce-motion it returns a static bolt at
 * rest so reduced-motion users see a calm, non-moving brand mark.
 *
 * Hands out the two **[State]s, not their `Float`s** (EXP-013). This is a `@Composable` that returns
 * a value, so it is not restartable: `val phase by transition.animateFloat(…)` recorded the read in
 * the *caller's* scope, which meant [FlashBrandAnimation] recomposed on every frame of a 2.4 s loop —
 * rebuilding its modifier chain, re-allocating the `Canvas` draw lambda and one `FlashBrandPhase`
 * per frame — and then handed the draw block two constants it could not animate on its own.
 *
 * That was the worst place in the app to pay for recomposition: this is the launch splash, so it runs
 * while the whole transport stack is booting, on the device where boot is slowest (ERROR-034 — on the
 * Belfone SCP810 boot outlasts the 6 s splash ceiling). Reading `.value` inside the draw block instead
 * keeps the animation in the draw phase: a new frame invalidates draw only, composition never re-runs,
 * and the CPU the splash used to spend on itself is available to the boot it is covering for.
 *
 * Same easings, same durations, same `PULSE_MS`, same static reduce-motion fallback as before.
