/**
 * Production composition seam over the WebSocket mesh stack (Phase-4 UI wiring, path A).
 *
 * The full transport stack — [FlashNetwork] + [FlashChatRepository] + [FlashTransferRepository]
 * plus the inbound/outbound framing collectors — is assembled inside [DiscoveryEngineHolder]
 * (historically reachable only from the Dev Console and background service). This facade is the
 * single injectable entry point that boots that holder from the app lifecycle and republishes its
 * subsystems, so the Compose shell can bind to real data instead of the sample/hardcoded state.
 *
 * Booting is idempotent: [DiscoveryEngineHolder.ensureStarted] serializes start/stop under its own
 * mutex and returns the already-running engine on repeat calls, so the Dev Console, the background
 * service, and this facade all share the same singletons — there is never a second WS server or a
 * duplicate NSD engine.
 *
 * The subsystem accessors are null until [ready] flips true; callers observe [ready] and read the
 * accessors only once booted (the holder sets `current*()` before `ensureStarted` returns, so a
 * `ready == true` observation always sees non-null subsystems).
