 * [isLoading] and [isError] are the screen's boot state and are required, not defaulted
 * (ERROR-034). The transfers page has had Loading and Error branches all along and both were
 * unreachable, because every caller mapped a list and left the flags false — so before the engine
 * booted the tab asserted "No transfers yet", which is a claim about this device's history made by
 * code that had not yet been given access to it. Making the parameters mandatory means a new call
 * site has to state what it knows.
 *
 * Note that an empty list from a *booted* repository is a real answer: `activeTransfers` is
 * in-memory and starts genuinely empty, so unlike the chat list there is no first-emission gap to
 * cover here — pre-boot is the whole of it.
