/**
 * The Nearby screen's peer lists, which have now failed twice in the same way.
 *
 * The defect this pins (`PAIRING-HANDOVER.md` queue item 1, "the trusted peer doesn't appear after
 * accepting"): the row list was a plain `val` computed in the composable body and captured by the
 * `remember`ed `derivedStateOf`, so it froze at the first composition — while `trustedIds`, read
 * *inside* the lambda, stayed live. A `derivedStateOf` tracks snapshot state; a plain value is a
 * constant to it. The consequence was not a stale label but a **disappearing device**: the id had
 * entered `trustedIds`, which filters `peers`, while the rows were still empty, so the peer was in
 * neither list.
 *
 * The handover asked for one live log to confirm this. It is confirmed here instead, because the
 * mechanism is in the source and the invariant is pure — [nearbyUiStateOf] takes no engine, no
 * Compose and no scope.
