/**
 * The Settings tab's storage card, which is what makes the "Clear received files" confirmation
 * dialog reachable at all on desktop.
 *
 * Two defects are pinned here, both found on 2026-09-14 by a human reporting that clicking Clear did
 * nothing:
 *
 * 1. **The scan and the clear ignored the engine's received root.** Both re-derived
 *    `~/FlashReceived` from the user home, so a `DesktopEngine(receivedRoot = …)` — the constructor
 *    every desktop test uses — reported and deleted a directory the engine was not writing to.
 * 2. **Nothing ever called the scan.** `DesktopShell` passed `onRefreshStorageUsage = { }` and left
 *    `receivedFilesBytes` at its null default, and `FlashStorageMath.canClearReceivedFiles` enables
 *    the control only for a scan with `totalBytes != null && > 0`. So the control was permanently
 *    disabled and the dialog could not be opened — not a broken dialog, an unreachable one.
 *
 * The second defect is a wiring fact and is asserted where it lives (`DesktopShell`); what a unit
 * test can hold is the first, which is why these cases use a temp root that is deliberately NOT
 * `~/FlashReceived`: if the implementation ever goes back to the hardcoded path, every assertion
 * below fails rather than silently reading the developer's real received-files folder.
