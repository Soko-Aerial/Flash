/**
 * The link that was broken, asserted without a phone.
 *
 * The failure this suite is named after looked like a *pairing* bug and was not one: the desktop
 * discovered the phone, showed it in the roster, and then Pair said "Couldn't reach" because the
 * engine held **zero sessions** — the auto-dial sweep that turns a discovered row into a live
 * session never ran. Nothing about that is specific to a phone: two engines in this one JVM
 * discover each other through the same `CompositeDiscovery`, and each must arrive at a live session
 * with the other through the same sweep. So this is that chain, end to end and hermetic —
 * `discoveredEndpoints` → auto-dial → `activeSessions` → the session [DesktopEngine.pairing] sends
 * on. If a future change re-couples the sweep to anything that can fail, this goes red instead of
 * the user finding it on a hardware run.
 *
 * Only the two LOCAL edges are asserted. That a *remote* phone is also dialed needs the hardware
 * gate ([docs/migration/PAIRING-GATE-RUNBOOK.md]).
