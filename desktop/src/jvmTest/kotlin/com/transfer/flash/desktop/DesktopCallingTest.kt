/**
 * Phase 33a — the desktop call lifecycle owner is wired, audio-only, outgoing only.
 *
 * Boots the real [DesktopEngine] headless (same `assemble()` `:desktop:run` executes) and
 * pins the three properties a hardware run cannot check in CI:
 *
 * 1. the shared `CallCoordinator` exists after boot and is idle (no phantom call);
 * 2. the Group Phase 0 trust closure holds: an untrusted peer cannot be called, and the
 *    refusal happens BEFORE any media is touched (safe to assert headless — no microphone
 *    is opened, on any machine);
 * 3. the inbound router is ordered: chat traffic is NOT a call frame, so it must fall
 *    through (`false`) to the chat/pairing/transfer handlers below it.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT assert: media flowing. That needs a microphone, a peer
 * and a human — the Phase 33 acceptance test, run by the owner on hardware.
