/**
 * Boots the real [DesktopEngine] — the same `assemble()` `:desktop:run` executes — in a JVM with no
 * window, no phone and no human.
 *
 * **Why this suite exists.** `assemble()` is one long bring-up whose failures are almost all
 * invisible from the outside. The bug it was written after is the archetype: a `require` on
 * `CompositeDiscovery.startAll`'s aggregate result aborted the composition *after* discovery had
 * already started advertising, so the app showed a discovered peer, held zero sessions, never
 * dialed, and printed nothing explaining why — the transfers tab simply never left its loading
 * state. `:desktop:run` cannot catch that class of failure (it needs a human to interpret a GUI),
 * and the Phase 16 harness cannot either (it discards the same result and never boots
 * `DesktopEngine` at all). One assertion — *did the composition reach a runnable state?* — does.
 *
 * **What it deliberately does NOT assert.** That a peer is discovered, dialed, or paired. All three
 * need a real second device on the LAN, so they belong to the hardware gate
 * (`docs/migration/PAIRING-GATE-RUNBOOK.md`), not here. This suite is the check that runs on every
 * machine, every time, and it is the one that would have failed on the evening this was found.
